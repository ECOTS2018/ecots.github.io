      <description>Creating a Github Organization Github allows for users to set up organizations where you can place material without it being all in your own github repository. This allows for some nice functionality:
 Separates out personal content from your organization or class materials. Allows for additional administrators to have full access to repos. Allows for easy transfer of ownership.  How do we create one?  In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.</description>
